● Assignment 2

Para 1:
● Firstly, I  imported all the relevant libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot,
seaborn, tensorflow, etc.
● I had to create a separate environment for tensorflow and download all the
libraries in this new environment in order to use tensorflow.

Para 2:
● Secondly, now I fetch the required data of “CAT” (January 2009 to
December 2017) from yahoo finance.
● This step gave some errors. It took me a while to figure it out, but eventually I did.

Para 3:
● Third, now I defined our Q-Learning Agent using Greedy Epsilon scheme.
● . I defined the hyper parameters like discount factor (gamma), epsilon decay.
● Then I defined the conditions for exploration-exploitation.
● Then, I got the states. Following that, I defined a replay function which stores a
mini batch of data which will help improve my DQN even further.
● Followed by, i defined my buy function, in which I defined three conditions
which leads to our DQN signalling buy, sell or hold.
● Lastly, I defined our train function, which will be used later on to train my agent.
● There were some logical errors and conditional errors that I had to deal with, and
I tried to play around with hyper-parameters to make the model more efficient,
but after about an 1 hour of debugging, it was up and running.

Para 4:
● Fourth, now we train our dataset using initial_money of 10,000$, batch_size = 32
and window_size = 30.
● Then we observe the total rewards, cost and total money achieved at each
iteration starting from 10 to 200 with a checkpoint at every 10 iterations.
● We found out that at 200th iteration , we have
achieved a reward of around 132.6$ and total money rose to 10,132.6$. (testing the
dataset)
● I had no problems to implement this step.

Para 5:
● Fifth, now we are testing the agent showcasing every stock we bought, sold or
hold on to with its connected investment and total balance after the action.
● Now, at the end of 200 days, we have achieved a total balance of around 10,014.600018$
with a profit of 14.600018$. 
● But in the long run, after 2252 days, we have achieved a total balance of 10,010.329$
with a total profit of 10.329$.
● This step took a long time to implement. At one point, I thought it was in an
infinite loop, but then after a very long time, it actually gave results.

Part 6:
● Sixth, now we are plotting all our signals and showcasing our plot in the end.
● This step was implemented without any problems.
